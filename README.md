# the-modern-react-bootcamp-next-portion
The collection of completed project files from the Next.js portion of Colt Steele's The Modern React Bootcamp course on Udemy

The course has not been updated in more than a year so most of these files differ than what is covered in the videos.  The changes were to deprecated functions
but otherwise the concepts are the same.
